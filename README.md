# Bike Sales Analysis & Interactive Dashboard in Excel

## üìä Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of a bike sales dataset to uncover key factors influencing customer purchase decisions. The entire project, from data cleaning and analysis to final dashboard creation, was conducted using **Microsoft Excel**. It serves as a practical demonstration of how to leverage Excel's powerful features‚Äîincluding Power Query, advanced formulas, PivotTables, and interactive charts‚Äîto transform raw data into actionable business intelligence.

The goal is to move beyond simple sales numbers and understand the *'who,'* *'why,'* and *'when'* behind each purchase, ultimately providing strategic recommendations to drive sales and marketing efforts.

## üéØ Key Objectives

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** To process and sanitize raw CSV data into a structured and reliable format for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** To identify underlying patterns, relationships, and anomalies within the data using PivotTables.
- **Insight Generation:** To answer critical business questions about customer demographics, regional performance, and key purchase drivers.
- **Dashboard Creation:** To build a fully interactive dashboard that allows stakeholders to dynamically filter and explore the data to make informed decisions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used

- **Microsoft Excel:**
  - **Data Cleaning:** Power Query for initial transformation (or formulas for manual cleaning).
  - **Data Processing:** Advanced formulas (`IF`, `NUMBERVALUE`, `SUBSTITUTE`).
  - **Analysis:** PivotTables & PivotCharts.
  - **Visualization:** Interactive Charts (Column, Bar, Pie).
  - **Dashboarding:** Slicers for filtering and dynamic interactivity.

## üìà Analysis & Key Findings

The analysis focused on a dataset of 1,000 customers. Our exploration yielded several critical insights:

#### 1. The "Practical Commuter" is our Core Customer
The data clearly shows that bikes are purchased primarily for utility, not luxury.
- **The Income Paradox:** The **"Low" income bracket has the highest purchase rate (52%)**, indicating the bike is viewed as a cost-effective transportation solution.
- **The Commute Factor:** Over **50% of buyers have a commute of less than 2 miles**. Purchase intent drops significantly as commute distance increases.

#### 2. Lifestyle Outweighs Income
A customer's existing lifestyle and commitments are stronger predictors of a purchase than their raw income.
- Customers with **0-1 cars** are far more likely to buy a bike.
- Similarly, customers with **0-1 children** represent a key segment.

#### 3. Geographic & Demographic Hotspots
- **The Pacific Opportunity:** The Pacific region, while a smaller market, boasts the **highest purchase conversion rate at 59%**.
- **The Core Age Group:** Customers aged **30-45** are the largest and most engaged buying segment.

## üöÄ Strategic Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended:

1.  **Dual Marketing Strategy:** Create separate marketing campaigns: one focused on **value and cost-savings** for the low-income segment, and another focused on **lifestyle and performance** for the high-income segment.
2.  **Focus on the Pacific:** Allocate additional marketing budget to the Pacific region to capitalize on its high conversion rate and expand market share.
3.  **Prioritize Sales Leads:** Implement a lead-scoring system that gives higher priority to leads with short commutes, low car ownership, and who fall within the 30-45 age demographic.
4.  **Explore Product Expansion:** Initiate R&D for an **electric bike model** to target the currently underserved long-commute market segment.

## üìñ How to Use This Project

1.  **Download** the `Bike Sales Analysis.xlsx` file.
2.  **Explore the 'Clean Data' Tab:** Review the raw data and the calculated columns used for analysis (`Income_Clean`, `Purchase_Flag`, `Age Group`, etc.).
3.  **Review the 'PivotTable Analysis' Tab:** See how the different PivotTables were constructed to derive insights.
4.  **Interact with the 'Dashboard' Tab:** Use the slicers for `Region`, `Gender`, `Marital Status`, etc., to dynamically filter the charts and explore the data for yourself.
